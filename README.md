# Intermediate Deep Learning Feature Coding
This repository contains a python implementation for the ACMMM2019 paper "Lossy Intermediate Deep Learning Feature Compression and Evaluation". This work is partially adopted by Visual Feature Coding (VFC) Workgroup in [AVS](http://www.avs.org.cn/english/) (Audio Video Coding Standard Workgroup of China). You may refer to the reference software provided by VFC Workgroup for the C++ implementation.

More descriptions for the codes will be updated soon.
